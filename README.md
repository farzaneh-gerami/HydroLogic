# HydroLogic

**HydroLogic** is a machine learning project focused on predicting the functionality of water pumps in Tanzania. Using features like location, water quality, and technical specifications, the goal is to classify pumps as:

- **Functional**
- **Functional Needs Repair**
- **Non-Functional**

This project is inspired by the [DrivenData: Pump it Up](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/) competition and aims to improve maintenance planning and water access across communities.
